# Documentation
This repo is for storing various documents that I find useful when configuring my development environments. These may include basic markdown files, screenshots, or scripts to be downloaded and run locally.

In some cases, I have replicated documents or scripts from other projects, generalizing the content for inclusion in this repo.

Additionally, all builds are test-cases for possible inclusion in other projects. Versions/Tags/Releases are automatically generated using GitHub Actions.

All code, screenshots, and/or information included in this repo have been created by me, unless otherwise noted.
